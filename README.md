# Music-Player
A simple Music Player made on Java - Swing

I've used an external library named as JacoMP3 and imported it's jar file.

And then used it's basic functions.

We can't use JSLider to edit volume of the music, for that we'll need MediaPlayer Library of JFX.

Beacuse the JacoMP3 library doesn't support setVolume(); method like MediaPlayer library does.
